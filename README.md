## Hello folks! :wave:

I am excited to share some of my work with you and to chat about all those aspects that I cannot share publicly, so get in [![touch](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gVE0j.png)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paolo-andrich/)!

I am a Data Scientist at the World Food Programme and I use statistical analysis and machine learning in Python to try to make our society more efficient and fairer.
