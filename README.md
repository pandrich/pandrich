## Hello folks! :wave:
***

I am excited to share some of my work with you! 

I work on Python projects

I am very interested in learning about the use of geospatial and spatial data in machine learning applications to make our society more efficient and fairer.
If anyone wants to share this journey with me hit me up on LinkedIn!
